## 🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This

As a student, I was tired of using 3–4 different apps to manage my classes, tasks, and daily routines. So I built StudyBuddy to combine them all in one place. This project also helped me grow my skills in real-world app development — especially with Firebase, Flutter, and state management.
